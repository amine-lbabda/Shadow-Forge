# Shadow-Forge
Shadow-Forge is a game built using SDL 1.2 and C

This video game is built to showcase our skills in making games from scratch using SDL 1.2 and C language which we will be participating with it in GD3 event which showcases our games to the world ! (Kind of like Game expo stuff)

More details will be added and revealed as we step into our project !

To run it,just head to the sources file and run `make` 


# Linux users (ubuntu 18.04,20.04 & 22.04 users)
Before running `make` make sure to install all the recommended libraries and run it using Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 (22.04 not tested yet and latest version does not support this old version of SDL !) with the usage of this command:

`sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libpulse-dev 
libxt-dev`


Also,make sure to install a compiler like gcc and also make,luckily, linux users can install a bundle containing gcc,g++,make... with one command: `sudo apt install build-essential`

TODO:

1. Fixing the options menu in order to run correctly

2. Implementation of the gameplay (not yet ready as we don't have the spritsheets and the logic)

3. Maybe an experiment with SDL 2.0 (And SDL 3.0) !     

**NOTE** :You can check a branch which will be created later and it will be having a version made by myself but currently we are at SDL 1.2 due to educational stuff 

**NOTE**: You can run our game in windows using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and our game runs smoothely on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 only (Ubuntu 22.04 not tested and Ubuntu 24.04 doesn't support SDL 1.2,only supports SDL > 2)
